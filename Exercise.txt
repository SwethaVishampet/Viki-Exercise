EXERCISE:

Using any language of your choice write a script that does
the following

Call: http://api.viki.io/v4/videos.json?app=100250a&per_page=10&page=1

To go to next page of response you have to increment the page number
in the above url. As long as the "more" field returns true, you have
more data available.

The response is a JSON object which has a response key which is an
array of more JSON objects. Each of them has a key called flags and
within flags there is a key called hd.

Print out how many response objects have flags:hd set to true and how
many have hd set to false.

SOLUTION:

Used PHP as the script.With the help of cURL and two functions called callURL and ProcessPage, the above is achieved.
